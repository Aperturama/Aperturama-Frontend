# Potential Future Improvements
- Collection cards as a grid (not implemented due to issues with height being equal to width and being unable to fix that)
- Global grid size (or one that gets saved/loaded to local storage and remembered across sessions)
- Photo and collection IDs in the URL for reloaded pages to work properly
- Ability to swipe left/right on photos to move to the next/previous
- Video support
- More animations (See https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/animation/page-route-animation, https://pub.dev/packages/simple_animations, https://flutter.github.io/samples/animations.html)
- A splash screen (https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/splash-screen)
- Proper looking name/app icon on Android
- "No Media :(" or no collections messages
