# Aperturama-Frontend



# Potential Future Improvements
- Collection cards as a grid (not implemented due to issues with height being equal to width and being unable to fix that)
- Global grid size (or one that gets saved/loaded to local storage and remembered across sessions)
- Photo and collection IDs in the URL for reloaded pages to work properly
